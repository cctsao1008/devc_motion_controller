# About
**Small Matrix Inverse** (*SMI*) is a portable, [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) optimised library for [matrix inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix) of 2, 3, and 4 order (square) matrices. It is written in pure [C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99) combined with LLVM/SSE/NEON [compiler intrinsics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_function). The 4x4 routines are based on Intel's "[Streaming SIMD Extensions - Inverse of 4x4 Matrix](ftp://download.intel.com/design/pentiumiii/sml/24504301.pdf)."

# Why Another Library

What does SMI bring to the table that the existing open source scientific libraries lack? (E.g. Eigen, NT2, Blitz++.)

  1. Hand-optimised SIMD routines for non-SSE architectures, such as ARM. (SMI targets all LLVM supported architectures.)
  2. Hand-optimised SIMD routines for 2x2 and 3x3 inversion.
  3. An easy-to-use, drag-and-drop, no-template-madness-[WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) structure/interface.

# Installation
Each matrix operation consists of a single C-function embedded in a header. Simply copy the relevant header (e.g. "[invert2x2-llvm.h](https://github.com/niswegmann/small-matrix-inverse/blob/master/invert2x2_llvm.h)" or "[invert4x4-sse.h](https://github.com/niswegmann/small-matrix-inverse/blob/master/invert4x4_sse.h)") into your project.

# Usage

SMI is straightforward to use. Include the appropriate header and you're good to go:

```c
#include "invert4x4-llvm.h"
...
float M[16] __attribute__((aligned(16))) =
    {
        + 1.0f, + 2.0f, - 1.0f, + 3.0f,
        - 5.0f, + 1.0f, - 4.0f, - 2.0f,
        - 3.0f, + 8.0f, + 2.0f, - 4.0f,
        + 7.0f, - 9.0f, - 4.0f, - 6.0f
    };

float Minv[16] __attribute__((aligned(16)));

invert4x4(M, Minv);
...
```

Input matrices must be non-singular and can be in either row-major or column-major order -- it doesn't matter since for all non-singular matrices **M** *transpose*(*invert*(*transpose*(**M**))) is equal to *invert*(**M**). If the input matrix is singular, the result is undefined. For the sake of efficiency remember to align input and output buffers.

# Supported Architectures
The goal is to support all commen architectures for 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 matrices. LLVM covers both x86, x86-64, and ARMv7, but specialised versions for ARM NEON are planned.

For completeness there is also an 1x1 C-version.

Here's an overview of the currently supported architectures:

|     | C     | LLVM  | SSE   | NEON  |
| --: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1x1 |   ✓   |   -   |   -   |   -   |
| 2x2 |   ✓   |   ✓   |   -   |   -   |
| 3x3 |   ✓   |   -   |   -   |   -   |
| 4x4 |   ✓   |   ✓   |   ✓   |   -   |

# Benchmark
SMI hasn't been proberly benchmarked yet. However, initial tests indicates a 50% to 100% performance increase over the matrix inverse routines in Apple's new SIMD library which targets 2x-, 3x-, and 4x- vectors/matrices.
